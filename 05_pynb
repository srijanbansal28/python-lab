Tuple Operations and File Operations**
    - **a. Python program for tuple operations:**
    ```python
    def tuple_operations():
        my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
        
        # Adding an item (tuples are immutable, so create a new tuple)
        new_tuple = my_tuple + (6,)
        print(new_tuple)
        
        # Displaying the length of the tuple
        print(len(new_tuple))
        
        # Checking for an item in the tuple
        print(3 in new_tuple)
        
        # Accessing an item
        print(new_tuple[2])

    tuple_operations()
    ```

    - **b. Python program to find longest and shortest word from a file:**
    ```python
    def file_operations():
        with open('textfile.txt', 'w') as file:
            for _ in range(5):
                file.write(input("Enter a line of text: ") + '\n')
        
        with open('textfile.txt', 'r') as file:
            words = file.read().split()
            longest = max(words, key=len)
            shortest = min(words, key=len)
            print(f"Longest word: {longest} with length {len(longest)}")
            print(f"Shortest word: {shortest} with length {len(shortest)}")

    file_operations()
